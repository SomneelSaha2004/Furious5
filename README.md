# Furious Five 🃏

A real-time multiplayer card game built with TypeScript, React, and Socket.IO. Race to get your hand total under 5 points and call the game to win!

## 🎮 Game Overview

Furious Five is a fast-paced card game for 2-5 players where strategy meets quick thinking. Players compete to achieve the lowest hand total while managing risk and timing their calls perfectly.

### How to Play

**Objective:** Get your hand total to 5 points or less, then call the game to win.

**Setup:**
- Each player starts with 5 cards
- Cards are worth their face value (Ace = 1, Face cards = 11-13)
- Players take turns in sequence

**Turn Actions:**
1. **Draw** a card from the deck OR pick up from the graveyard
2. **Drop** cards using these combinations:
   - **Single:** Any individual card
   - **Pair:** Two cards of the same rank
   - **Trips:** Three cards of the same rank  
   - **Quads:** Four cards of the same rank
   - **Straight:** 3+ consecutive cards (A-2-3, 2-3-4, etc.)

**Calling the Game:**
- When your hand total is ≤ 5 points, you can call the game
- All other players get one final turn
- Lowest total wins and takes the pot
- Tied lowest scores split the winnings

**Special Features:**
- 30-second turn timer with auto-play if time expires
- Real-time multiplayer with instant updates
- Dark/light theme support
- Automatic game state management
