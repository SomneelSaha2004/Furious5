Furious Five — Complete Rules (Robust Spec)
1) Overview

Players: 2–5

Deck: Standard 52-card deck (no jokers)

Direction: Clockwise

Hand size: Start with 5. After that, a player’s hand may be 1–5 cards at the end of their turn.

Goal: Start your turn holding a hand whose point total is < 5, then call the game.

Points: Ace=1; 2–10 face value; Jack=11; Queen=12; King=13.

Suits never affect points.

2) Setup

Shuffle and deal 5 cards to each player.

Put the rest of the cards face-down as the deck.

Choose a starting player (dealer’s left or at random). Play proceeds clockwise.

There is no discard pile at the start; the first “table drop” appears after the first turn’s drop.

3) Table Concepts

Table drop: The most recent set of cards a player placed face-up on their turn. Only this “live” pile may be taken from on the next turn.

Graveyard: The previous table drop(s) moved aside face-up. You cannot draw from the graveyard; it’s used only to reshuffle when the deck runs out.

4) Turn Structure (strict order)

On your turn, do exactly these steps:

Call (optional, timing-restricted).

You may only call at the start of your own turn (before any drop or draw).

You may call only if your current hand total is strictly less than 5.

Drop one combination (or a fallback single):

Pair (two of the same rank)

Trips (three of the same rank)

Quads (four of the same rank)

Straight (≥3 cards in sequence by rank; Ace is low only; suits irrelevant; no wrap/“Q-K-A”)

Fallback single: If you cannot form any of the above, you must drop exactly one card so turns always progress.

You drop exactly one set per turn (no multi-drops in base rules).

Your dropped cards become the new table drop; immediately move the previous table drop (if any) to the graveyard.

Draw exactly one card to finish your turn, choosing one:

Top of deck, or

From the current table drop under these constraints:

If the table drop is a straight (length ≥3), you may take only the lowest (start) or highest (end) card—not a middle card.

If the table drop is not a straight (pair/trips/quads/single, or a straight that has already been “nibbled” down to 2 cards), you may take any one card from it.

If the deck is empty when you need to draw, reshuffle the graveyard to form a new deck and continue drawing. (Leave the current table drop untouched.)

If both deck and graveyard are empty (rare), you simply cannot draw this turn; your turn still ends.

End of turn.

Hand size after your turn may be 1–5.

Play passes clockwise.

Important: Because you drop before you draw, the card you draw cannot be used in the drop you just played. It sets up future turns.

5) Calling & Settlement

You may only call at the start of your turn (Step 1 above) if your hand total is < 5. Calling immediately ends the round and everyone reveals.

Let the caller’s total be C and each other player’s total be Tᵢ.
Let L be the lowest total in the table.

A) Caller is strictly lowest (C = L and unique)

Each other player pays the caller (Tᵢ − C). The caller receives the sum of those differences.

B) Caller fails (someone else is strictly lower, or caller ties for lowest)

Find the lowest total L among non-caller players:

The caller pays a lump sum equal to

∑
all players 
𝑗
≠
(chosen lowest)
(
𝑇
𝑗
−
𝐿
)
all players j

=(chosen lowest)
∑
	​

(T
j
	​

−L)

to a single lowest player chosen by clockwise tie-break (first lowest player you encounter going clockwise from the caller).
(This deterministic tie-break keeps gameplay simple; you can optionally split among all tied-lowest as a variant.)

Notes on ties

If the caller ties for lowest (not strictly lowest), the call is a fail.

If multiple non-caller players tie for lowest, apply the clockwise tie-break to choose who receives the payment.

Examples

You call at 3; others are 9, 10, 7 → you receive (6 + 7 + 4) = 17.

You call at 6; others are 3, 7, 9 → lowest is 3, you pay (6−3)+(7−3)+(9−3) = 13 to that lowest player.

You call at 4; others are 4, 8 → you tie for lowest → fail; pay (4−4)+(8−4)=4 to the lowest by clockwise tie-break (the opponent with 4).

6) Valid Combinations (details)

Pair/Trips/Quads: All cards must be the same rank.

Straight:

Minimum length 3.

Ranks must be consecutive (e.g., 4-5-6-7).

Ace is 1 and low only: A-2-3 is valid; Q-K-A is not.

Suits irrelevant.

Fallback single: Only when you cannot make any set/straight this turn.

Nibbling a straight on the table

If a player takes an end card from a table straight, it remains a straight with one fewer card.

If a table straight shrinks to 2 cards, it is no longer a straight for draw purposes; the next player may take either of the two cards.

7) Illegal/Blocked Actions

Passing is not allowed. If you can’t form a valid set/straight, you must drop a single.

Calling out of turn, calling after you’ve dropped/drawn, or calling with total ≥ 4.999… (i.e., ≥5) are invalid.

You may only take from the current table drop (the one just placed by the previous player), never from the graveyard.

8) Ending a Round & Continuing Play

A round ends immediately upon a valid call and settlement is paid.

Start a new round by shuffling and dealing 5 each again, keeping chip tallies running.

You can play a fixed number of rounds or to a target ledger (e.g., first to +100).

9) Practical Clarifications

Hand size between actions: It’s okay to momentarily hit 0 right after a large drop (e.g., a 5-card straight) because you will draw 1 before your turn ends; only the end-of-turn hand size must be 1–5.

Single-card table drop: If the previous player dropped a single, you may take that single as your draw-from-table option.

Reshuffle timing: Only reshuffle when someone must draw and the deck is empty. Leave the current table drop untouched when reshuffling.

Suits & points: Suits never change point values. Only ranks contribute to points.

10) Optional Variants (toggle by house rule)

Ace duality in straights: Allow Q-K-A as high; keep A-2-3 as low (choose one or both).

Split failed-call payout among all tied-lowest instead of clockwise tie-break.

Multi-drop turns: Permit playing multiple sets/straights in one turn (faster rounds).

Call threshold ≤5 (instead of <5) to encourage more calls.

11) Glossary

Call: End the round at the start of your turn because your hand total is < 5.

Table drop: The live, face-up cards from the most recent turn; can be taken from by the next player following the rules above.

Graveyard: Face-up archive of older table drops; only used for reshuffling.

One-turn Example (walkthrough)

You begin your turn with A♣, 2♦, 3♥, 5♠, 5♦ (total = 1+2+3+5+5 = 16, so you cannot call).

You drop the straight A-2-3 onto the table.

The previous table drop (if any) goes to the graveyard.

You then draw: either top of the deck, or if the previous player had a straight on the table you may take its low or high card; if it wasn’t a straight (or was 2 cards), you may take any one card from it.

Your turn ends with 1–5 cards in hand; play passes clockwise.
